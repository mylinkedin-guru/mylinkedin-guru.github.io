                    <p>One of the biggest challenges any marketer can face is choosing the right tools which can help them generate the most leads. Though it’s safe to say that if no action is taken, no amount of tools can generate more traffic which leads to sales. So before you start investing in new fancy tools and gadgets, ask yourself the question: “Am I going to use them in the right way?” If the answer is yes and you do have a strategy on how these tools can serve you, then let's get into some of them.</p>
                    <hr class="space m" /> 

                    <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                    <p>The first digital marketing tool that we consider worth leading with is Google Analytics. Though it’s safe to say it doesn’t lack popularity, you’ll be surprised how many marketers still ignore its potential. It tracks your visitor count and data, creating visitor behavior statistics.
                    Google Analytics will show you how people are engaging throughout the site and what causes the most conversions. When optimizing a website, it’s important to always keep in mind that it should always be optimized for traffic which causes conversions and not just for any type of traffic.</p>
                    <img class="img-blog" src="images/blog/traffic.png" alt="Google Analytics/>
                    <h3>Google Search Console</h3>
                    <p>The second digital marketing tool that should be a part of every marketer’s arsenal is Google Search Console. It’s completely free and it’s basically Google explaining how to rank on Google. What this tool can be used for is to find out which existing content of your website already ranks in Google and expand it further. So go on Google Search Console and check which terms people are searching for which relate to some of your content, let’s say an article, but are still not mentioned there. Take these terms and keep adding them to the article, keep rewriting and expanding your content, and watch your SEO traffic organically grow.</p>
                    <hr class="space m" /> 

                    <h3>Hotjar</h3>
                    <p>This great visitor behavior analyzing tool is a must-have when trying to optimize the conversion and usability rate of your site. It shows you how web and mobile users behave when visiting your website, where they click, stay and what makes them leave.
                    It has a visual heatmap tool which reveals how the users interact with the website. It also records the visitors’ scrolling behavior and presents opportunities for growth and rate optimization. There are many tools which offer the same functionalities, but Hotjar comes with a free version which gives you the chance to see it in action before deciding to purchase the paid version.</p>
                    <hr class="space m" /> 

                    <h3>Ahrefs</h3>
                    <p>Ahrefs is a constantly-expanding SEO tool which covers SEO auditing, backlink analysis, content marketing analysis, keyword ranking positions, and keyword research.
                    It stands out from the herd of other similar services by the largest database of live links, huge index and the best speed of index updates.</p>
                    <hr class="space s" /> 
                    <p>By adding your domain to the Dashboard, you get features like domain health report with issues that need to be fixed, crawl report for search engine performance, new/lost backlinks reports, track keywords and many more. 
                    Ahrefs provides new ideas for link-building and content analysis; social stats and ratings; export of any data for further analysis on your own; various charts and graphs for visual representation and more.</p>

                    <h3>HubSpot</h3>
                    <p>The last digital marketing tool that we think is becoming absolutely essential in the marketing world is HubSpot. HubSpot is an all-in-one tool that helps you target personas and create online campaigns to drive qualified traffic, convert that traffic to leads and nurture the best leads into sales.</p>
                    <hr class="space s" /> 
                    <hr class="space s" /> 
                    <p>In 2006, HubSpot launched software designed to help companies switch to inbound marketing strategies like blogging, social media and content, rather than outbound ones like cold calling and cold mailing. It has many constantly growing features, but let’s mention the most famous ones.
                    Its product and services aim to provide tools for SEO, Content Marketing, Web Analytics, Social Media Marketing, Email Campaigns and Landing Pages.
                    <hr class="space m" /> 
                    <ul>
                    <li>It has its own CMS which allows you to create your website on their platform and never worry again about security and maintenance. </li>
                    <li>HubSpot helps companies brands attract more visitors, convert leads and close more deals.</li>
                    <li>HubSpot is a tool that helps you target persons and create online campaigns to drive qualified traffic, convert the traffic to leads and nurture the best leads.</li>
                    <li>Last but not least, HubSpot also has HubSpot Academy where you can learn various things about Sales and Marketing and also expertise in Inbound Marketing.

                    </ul>
                    <hr class="space m" /> 
                    To sum up, when it comes to marketing there is no one right way to do things. It’s all about taking action, performing a lot of tests, creating a good strategy and paying attention to your target group’s needs. Though these tools are a great way to make this whole process more efficient and help you get one step closer to your marketing goals.</p>
